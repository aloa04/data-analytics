The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down\t clean and refill of the shocks\t and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps\t so he need the shocks\t shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so\t Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road\t pavement speed runs\t dirt track racing...)\t our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40\t 45 and 50 weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly\t we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil\t for uses as I have described above\t then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended\t especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"TTM-Funktionsmodellbau\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£7.64\"\"}\n on 24 Feb. 2015 // good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£8.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£8.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"trainmad\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£7.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£28.63\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 11 April 2015 // He loved it\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Modelsales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"BuySend\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£15.79\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£37.69\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 21 Jan. 2016 // top toy\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.94\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"GiftLocalUK\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.96\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Sell 24x7\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£13.07\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Fun Fuzion\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£10.38\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Life Unearthed\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£14.31\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Venture Blue\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£14.47\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Mini Model Shop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£12.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£16.31\"\"}\n on 1 Mar. 2015 // well pleased with item and service many thanks\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£12.62\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£12.64\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£12.72\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£12.77\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£11.76\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"DVDCineShop\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.34\"\"}\n on 1 Jan. 2015 // Very good had to return due to ordering wrong scale\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£6.93\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Amazon.co.uk\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£6.95\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£24.11\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 17 Sept. 2014 // verygood\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£52.97\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Frome Models Centre\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£52.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"tablet_books\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£85.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"MEGA-MAG\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£114.59\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"japazon\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£123.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"Sam Store US\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£300.25\"\"}]}\"\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n on 23 Sept. 2014 // have not finished the decals and colors yet but it is good\"\t\"{\"\"seller\"\"=>[{\"\"Seller_name_1\"\"=>\"\"Models4hobby\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_1\"\"=>\"\"£10.48\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_2\"\"=>\"\"Hair Skin Beauty\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_2\"\"=>\"\"£10.50\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_3\"\"=>\"\"jadlamracingmodels\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_3\"\"=>\"\"£10.56\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_4\"\"=>\"\"Buy-For-Less-Online\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_4\"\"=>\"\"£11.22\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_5\"\"=>\"\"GamesQuest\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_5\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_6\"\"=>\"\"UKBulksales\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_6\"\"=>\"\"£13.39\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_7\"\"=>\"\"Model Kits Direct\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_7\"\"=>\"\"£9.14\"\"}\t {\"\"Seller_name_8\"\"=>\"\"McKeeman Models\"\"\t \"\"Seller_price_8\"\"=>\"\"£10.99\"\"}\n on 4 Oct. 2014 // Dispatched quickly and just as advertised…a brand new model kit in a sealed box.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard’s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard’s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ‘A4 Preservation Society’, later known as ‘The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd’ and now ‘The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd’. ‘The A4 Locomotive Society’ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail\t you can see into the windows\t each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one\t and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost\t I would not let young children play with it on their own\t but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By\tnull\tnull\tnull\tnull\n306c1134a160c445a7024b1e75da0560\tHornby R1153 London 2012 00 Gauge Electric Train Set\tHornby\tnull\t1 new\t8\t6\t4.3 out of 5 stars\tHobbies > Model Trains & Railway Sets > Rail Vehicles > Trains\thttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Hornby-R1139-Rapier-Class-Electric/dp/B003FGWHN4 | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hornby-R1071-Eurostar-Gauge-Electric/dp/B000QUNA3S | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hornby-Majestic-E-Link-Gauge-Electric/dp/B00BUKPXU6 | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hornby-R1167-Flying-Scotsman-Electric/dp/B006ZL69JO | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hornby-Gauge-Eurostar-2014-Train/dp/B00TQNJIIC | http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hornby-R1155-Virgin-Pendolino-Electric/dp/B0051TCMTM\tProduct Description Hornby R1153 London 2012 OO Gauge Electric Train Set Commemorating Britain's Olympic triumphs This Hornby London 2012 train set is inspired by the iconic pictogram designs which represent the various sports and disciplines of the Games.
